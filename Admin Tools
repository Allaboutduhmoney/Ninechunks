command /admin:
  permission: Admin.Commands.Help
  permission message: You're not part of our administration team. If this is an error report it to your developers right away!
  trigger:
    make player execute command "/menu open Admin"
    
    
    
    
When making this you need to make sure you have CreateYourOwnMenus as it will help because CYOM is a simple system where you can create, open, delete, and edit menus.
When making a button for a menu remember to do /menu script add {inset command} so that the button will work.

I have a server that uses CYOM. It's 1.14.4 and the IP is 213.202.242.29:17846 and play.ninechunks.com
If you decide to look at the things I've made you can go on it and use /oreshop, /woodshop, and /spawnershop. All of which I made with a script just like this.
